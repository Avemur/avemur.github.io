                    Hi - my name is Vaibhav (`VY-BUV`) & I'm a software engineer based in Brooklyn, NY.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Previously, I worked at Lyft, where I helped predict and incentivize upcoming rides. I also worked on 
                    walking optimization, improving search, and denoising inaccurate GPS location. Prior to Lyft, I studied Computer Science at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I quit working at Lyft in August of 2022 for a much-needed break & I'm currently working part-time as a bike mechanic while consulting for a startup.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I enjoy greenfield development, building things from scratch, rapid prototyping, and solving tough, real-world problems.
                    <br />
                    <br />
